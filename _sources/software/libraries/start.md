# Libraries

This page provides an overview of the libraries available on the HPC. Libraries are essential for enhancing functionality and performance in various applications and programming environments. This section includes instructions for loading and using these libraries on the HPC, as well as advice on submitting jobs that require specific libraries.

To see the available libraries, use the `module avail` command. To load a library, use the `module load <modulename>` command. For example, to load the HDF5 library, use `module load hdf5`.
