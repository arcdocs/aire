# Requesting new software

We have a wide variety of research software installed on Aire. However, we may not always have the software you are looking for. In this situation, there are a couple of options:

1. **Check Conda package management system**: We offer Miniforge to manage Conda environments on Aire, providing a lightweight and flexible way to install a wide range of scientific packages. Check if the software is available within the Conda package management system.

2. **Build from source**: You can try building the software from source in your home or scratch directories. Most software comes with a README file that includes installation instructions. For guidance, please refer to the [Research Computing team's website](https://arc.leeds.ac.uk/) and the [HPC2 training material](https://arctraining.github.io/hpc2-software/welcome.html), which provide useful resources for building software from source.

3. **Request software installation**: If the software will be used by many users, you can request it to be installed as a module on Aire. Submit your request via our <a href="https://it.leeds.ac.uk/it?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=48d5a6d70f275f00a82247ece1050ea0" target="_blank">HPC Application Install form</a>.

We are here to support your research needs, so please reach out if you need assistance with software installation or have any other queries. Additionally, we are working on the Spack documentation and will provide instructions on how to build your own software using Spack.
