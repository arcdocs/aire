# Compute node types

The Aire HPC cluster is composed of various types of compute nodes, each designed to handle specific computational tasks and workloads. This section provides an overview of the different compute node types available, including standard compute nodes, high-memory nodes, and GPU nodes. Each type offers unique capabilities to meet the diverse needs of users.

## Standard compute node

- 52 nodes
- Dell R6625 servers
- AMD Dual 84 core 2.2GHz (9634 Genoa-X)
- Dual 480GB M2 drives
- 768GB DDR5-4800 Memory

## High-memory node

- 2 nodes
- Dell R6625 servers
- AMD Dual 84 core 2.2GHz (9634 Genoa-X)
- Dual 480GB M2 drives
- 2.3TB DDR5-4800 Memory

## GPU node

- 28 nodes
- Dell R7615 servers
- 3 x NVIDIA L40S 48GB GPUs (PCIe)
- AMD 24 core 2.9GHz (9254 Genoa-X)
- Dual 480GB M2 drives
- 256GB DDR5-4800 Memory
- **84 GPU cards** total

## Purchasing additional Aire nodes

If your project requires additional resources, you can purchase nodes for priority access within the Aire HPC system. Please review the guidelines below and contact Research IT for more details.

### Guidelines for node purchases

- **Quote Details:** The quoted price will cover only the cost of the hardware. Management and maintenance of the system are provided centrally and are not included in the hardware quote.
- **Data Centre Capacity:** The number of nodes that can be added depends on available space in the data centre. Please consult with Research IT to confirm the current capacity.
- **Node Lifespan:** All purchased nodes are managed as part of Aire’s infrastructure and will remain available until the system’s retirement date of 31/07/2029, regardless of purchase timing.
- **Access Model:** Purchasing a node grants priority access to its resources, not exclusive ownership. This policy maximises resource utilisation and promotes energy efficiency. For specific arrangements, please discuss with Research IT.

### Estimated node costs

| Node Name                 | Cores per Node | Memory per Node | Processor                | Estimated Cost |
| ------------------------- | -------------- | --------------- | ------------------------ | -------------- |
| Aire Standard CPU Node    | 168            | 768GB           | 2 x AMD 9634 2.25GHz 84c | £ 12,315 +VAT  |
| Aire High-Memory CPU Node | 168            | 2.3TB           | 2 x AMD 9634 2.25GHz 84c | £ 19,580 +VAT  |
| Aire GPU Node             | 24             | 256GB           | 3 x NVIDIA L40S PCIe     | £ 14,600 +VAT  |

Please reach out to Research IT to discuss your specific needs, obtain a quote, and explore how additional nodes can enhance your research project.

### Requesting Research Software Engineering support

In addition to infrastructure, we also offer Research Software Engineering (RSE) support to help researchers make the most of the available resources. Our RSE team can provide expertise in optimising code, parallelising workflows, and ensuring efficient usage of HPC systems.
