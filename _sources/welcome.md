# Aire User Documentation

This site documents information relevant to users of Aire, the High Performance Computing (HPC) facility at the [University of Leeds](https://www.leeds.ac.uk). It is oriented towards researchers with basic experience using a Unix-like command line interface (CLI).

Launched on the 6th of February 2025, Aire is the University of Leeds' latest HPC system, bringing cutting-edge computational power to support research across disciplines. With major upgrades in computing power, memory, and storage, Aire is set to enhance data processing and streamline research workflows.

New users may want to start by reading the [Getting Started](page:getting-started) section.

```{admonition} Upgrading from ARC3 and ARC4
Aire is the new HPC system replacing the ARC3 and ARC4 systems. The new system significantly increases compute capacity for the community while delivering a modern, maintainable software and programming environment. ARC3 and ARC4 are now completely unavailable, and all data stored on them that has not been moved off has been lost.
