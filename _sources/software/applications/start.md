# Applications

This page provides an overview of the applications available on the HPC. These applications are centrally installed and managed through the module system, ensuring they are optimised for our hardware and providing the best performance. This section includes instructions for loading and using these modules on the HPC, as well as advice on submitting jobs for these specific pieces of software.

To see the available applications, use the `module avail` command. To load an application, use the `module load <modulename>` command. For example, to load OpenFOAM, use `module load openfoam`.


<!-- TODO: add more sections when we have new modules installed -->
