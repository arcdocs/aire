We offer Spack as a central module on Aire for making quick test builds of available spack packages. For advanced usage, including making recipes for your own Spack packages, and managing Spack environments, we recommend users download their own version of Spack to their home directory, see [tutorial here](https://spack-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_basics.html).
