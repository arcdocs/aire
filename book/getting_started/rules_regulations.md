# Rules and Regulations for using Aire
Aire is an expensive and valuable shared HPC system that supports many users simultaneously. The rules and regulations are important for safe, fair and efficient use of the resource.

## Rules of use
* **Monitor email** when running jobs and respond to system administrators requests at your earliest opportunity.
* Use **login nodes** only for compiling software, submitting and managing jobs, and transferring data. Do not run processes on the login nodes that run for longer than 1 hour and use more than 8 cores, 40 GB of memory. 
* Use the **Slurm scheduler** to run processes on compute nodes.
* Follow **cybersecurity good practice**: Use strong passwords, never share credentials, and report suspicious activity immediately.
* **Protect sensitive data**: Aire can be used for **Tier 1** and **Tier 2** data (research data or software). Ensure compliance with institutional and legal requirements.
* Aire is not for personal use or for storing personal data.
* Abide by the conditions of special resource provisions.
* Acknowledge the use of Aire in research outputs.

## Consequences of Breaking the Rules
* Processes that interfere with others will be terminated **without warning**.
* Users who persist in disruptive practices may have their accounts **suspended**.
* If the issue is **not critical** and **not recurring**, system administrators will aim to resolve problems **informally via email**, before taking further action.

## Security and System Integrity
* In **exceptional circumstances**, system administrators may need to access or modify user files to:
 * Respond to a **cybersecurity incident** (for example, suspected hacking or malware).
 * Resolve a **critical system failure** that threatens service availability.
