# Interpreters

This page provides an overview of the interpreters available on the HPC. Interpreters are essential tools for running scripts and programs written in various programming languages. This section includes instructions for loading and using these interpreters on the HPC, as well as advice on submitting jobs that require specific interpreters.

To see the available interpreters, use the `module avail` command. To load an interpreter, use the `module load <modulename>` command. For example, to load Miniforge, use `module load miniforge`.
